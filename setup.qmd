title: Set-up
---

We will be using a JupyterHub for the workshop.

* <https://dhub.opensci.live/>
* Click Start Server
* Open terminal, type to get the tutorials

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/EDMW-3B-tutorials
```

You can also see [setup - R](content/02-local-setup-r.html) and [setup - Python](content/02-local-setup-python.html) to aset up on your computer but be aware that GDAL installation is problemmatic.

## Access to the JupyterHub

### GitHub username

* Create a GitHub account (if you donâ€™t already have one) at <https://github.com>. Advice for choosing a GitHub username: this is a professional username that you will use in work settings. GitHub accounts are not anonymous; this is for sharing work. Using your real name is common.
* Write down your username and password; you will need to log in during the course!
* Here is [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHXw4mGoqiE) showing the whole process

### Get on JupyterHub

Once you have submitted your GitHub username and have been accepted as a member of the DaskHub team on the nmfs-opensci organization, you can log-into the JupyterHub.

<https://dhub.opensci.live/>

* **Choose the default Py-R base geospatial image**. [Watch a video](https://youtu.be/o99jZWHqKi8) of the login process and basic JupyterHub orientation.

* home directory is yours and no one else can see it. To share files, you can connect to a GitHub repository or use the `shared` directory. Everyone can read and write to this directory. Please don't delete content that is not your own.

## Earthdata Login account (optional)

We will be using a public user account, but if you do a lot of work with NASA Earthdata, you should get a login account. 

* Create an Earthdata Login account (if you don't already have one) at <https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov>
* Write down your username and password; you will need it.
