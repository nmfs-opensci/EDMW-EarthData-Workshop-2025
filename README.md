## EDMW 2025: Introduction to using earth data in the cloud for scientific workflows: PACE hyperspectral ocean color data

**Instructors**: Eli Holmes (NOAA Fisheries), Ryan Vandermeulen (NOAA Fisheries)</br>
**Helpers**: 



### Overview

Earth science data is increasingly available from the cloud and due to the size of many of these dataset (Tb and Pb in some cases), data workflows are transitioning to workflows that involve programmatic access with either cloud-native analysis or server-side processing . In this workshop, participants will take part in hands-on tutorials on working with earth data in the cloud with Python and/or R using a JupyterHub (cloud computing platform) provisioned for geospatial analysis. This workshop will focus on [PACE hyperspectral ocean color data and products](https://pace.oceansciences.org/home.htm). Participants will go through tutorials to learn about the different PACE products, their value for used in ocean ecosystem and fisheries, and learn how to incorporate PACE data into their science projects via cloud-native and server-side workflows. Participants will also be exposed to the Python and R suite of geospatial packages for gridded and other spatial data.

### Aims and Objectives

* Learn how to discover and use PACE data available in the NASA Earth Data catalog
* Familiarize participants with hyperspectral ocean color data and the various products. 
* Obtain hands-on experience in accessing and vizualizing PACE data.
* Learn by doing and running through examples yourself. 

### What to expect

* We will have short introductions and then will work through tutorials together. You are encouraged to adapt the code to create output and examples for your own data and areas of interest.

* All tutorials and examples are developed openly and will be publicly available during and following the event. Participants will strengthen their practice of open science, using open source code and collaborating on their projects with course peers.
